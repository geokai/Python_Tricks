## Python Tricks, A Buffet of Awesome Python Features
### by [Dan Bader](https://dbader.org)


Python Tutorial book aimed at helping learners get past the initial _easy_ parts
and begin using Python's powerful features that set it apart from other
languages.

For this course, the projects will be implemented within Virtual Environments,
utilizing Python's **Virtualenv** library.

Along side the source code in each chapter's directory will also be found
**Jupyter Notebooks** containing my own experimentation, anotations and comments.

Each chapter directory will be treated as an individual virtual environment and
will contain its own _requirements.txt_ file.
